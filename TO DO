TO DO:

*IMPROVE DATA EFFICIENCY: Current way of accessing data is constantly reading/writing from a txt file. Instead I would like to retrive the 
data upon application start and store it in a arraylist. All data can then be updated and read form they arraylist. Auto update txt file data
every 5 minuets to just incase of an unexpected system failure.

*Update cade to add more scalability and flexablity.

*Improve documentation.

*Add data validation to all textfields.

*Improve UI design and experience.

*Put the data on a server so data can be accessed remotely giving the product mobility and scalablity.

*Impliment the analytics interface that can give insight into (Customers, monthly profits, what product makes the most profit ect.).

*Encrypt the data / make the over all system more secure.

*Impliment Twillow API to send customers specific prices based on the products they most commonly bring in and at what time.
